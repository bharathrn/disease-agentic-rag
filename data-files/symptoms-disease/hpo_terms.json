Clinical studies generally use electrical stimulation of peripheral nerves to elicit potentials. SSEP testing determines whether peripheral sensory nerves are able to transmit sensory information like pain, temperature, and touch to the brain. Abnormal SSEPs can result from dysfunction at the level of the peripheral nerve, plexus, spinal root, spinal cord, brain stem, thalamocortical projections, or primary somatosensory cortex."

Healthy subjects correct such perturbations with either one or two large steps, or without taking any steps, hinging rapidly at the hips while swinging the arms forward as a counterweight. In patients with balance impairment, balance correcting steps are often too small, forcing patients to take more than two steps. Taking three or more steps is generally considered to be abnormal, and taking more than five steps is regarded as being clearly abnormal. Markedly affected patients continue to step backward without ever regaining their balance and must be caught by the examiner (this would be called true retropulsion). Even more severely affected patients fail to correct entirely, and fall backward like a pushed toy soldier, without taking any corrective steps."

Due to weakness in the gluteus medius muscle, the hip on the side of the swinging leg drops with each step (referred to as Trendelenburg sign). The gait appears waddling. The patients frequently attempt to counteract the dropping of the hip on the swinging side by bending the trunk towards the side which is in the stance phase (in the German language literature this is referred to as Duchenne sign). Similar gait patterns can be caused by orthopedic conditions when the origin and the insertion site of the gluteus medius muscle are closer to each other than normal, for instance due to a posttraumatic elevation of the trochanter or pseudarthrosis of the femoral neck."

Type IV is the first lesion considered advanced in this classification because of the severe intimal disorganization caused by the lipid core. The characteristic core appears to develop from an increase and the consequent confluence of the small isolated pools of extracellular lipid that characterize type III lesions. The increase in lipid is believed to result from continued insudation from the plasma. Type IV lesions, when they first appear in younger people, are found in the same locations as adaptive intimal thickenings of the eccentric type. Thus, atheroma is, at least initially, an eccentric lesion."

The most common presentation is with ascites, but can range from fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) to asymptomatic forms. Obstruction of hepatic venous outflow is mainly caused by primary intravascular thrombosis, which can occur suddenly or be repeated over time, accompanied by some revascularization, accounting for the variable parenchymal hepatic damage and histologic presentation.

Plasma causes the vitreous gel to degenerate, contract, and eventually collapse which pulls on the retina.

During further development, the allantois becomes incorporated into the body of the embryo, connecting the ventral aspect of the urogenital sinus (which will develop into the upper pole of the urinary bladder) to the external portion of the umbilicus. Upon further development, the lumen of the allantois becomes obliterated and forms a thick fibrous cord called the urachus, which connects the apex of the bladder to the umbilicus. In adults, the urachus is known as the median umbilical ligament. Failure of the allantoic cavity to obliterate can result of one of four conditions: 1) congenital patent urachus (a completely open connection between bladder and umbilicus); 2) vesicourachal diverticulum (a diverticulum off the bladder but not communicating with the umbilicus); umbilical cyst and sinus (not communicating with the bladder); and 4) alternating urachal sinus.

The vitamin K-dependent protein C is the key component of the pathway. Activated protein C (APC) cleaves and inhibits coagulation cofactors FVIIIa and FVa, which result in downregulation of the activity of the coagulation system. The endothelial protein C receptor stimulates the T-TM-mediated activation of protein C on the endothelial cell surface.

The cysts range in size from a few millimeters to several centimeters in diameter, have variable wall thickness, and are lined by metaplastic bronchiolar epithelium. On chest radiographs, honeycombing appears as closely approximated ring shadows, typically 3-10 mm in diameter with walls 1-3 mm in thickness, that resemble a honeycomb; the finding implies end-stage lung disease. On CT scans, the appearance is of clustered cystic air spaces, typically of comparable diameters on the order of 3-10 mm but occasionally as large as 2.5 cm. Honeycombing is usually subpleural and is characterized by well-defined walls. It is a CT feature of established pulmonary fibrosis. Because honeycombing is often considered specific for pulmonary fibrosis and is an important criterion in the diagnosis of usual interstitial pneumonia, the term should be used with care, as it may directly impact patient care."

On chest radiographs, rounded atelectasis appears as a mass abutting a pleural surface, usually in the posterior part of a lower lobe. Distorted vessels have a curvilinear disposition as they converge on the mass (the comet tail sign). The degree of lobar retraction depends on the volume of atelectatic lung. It is almost invariably associated with other signs of pleural fibrosis (eg, blunting of costophrenic angle). CT is more sensitive for the detection and display of the characteristic features of rounded atelectasis. An additional sign is homogeneous uptake of contrast medium in the atelectatic lung."

Comment: Pulmonary surfactant is a highly surface-active mixture of proteins and lipids that is synthesized and secreted onto the alveoli by type II epithelial cells. The protein part of surfactant constitutes of four types of surfactant proteins (SP), SP-A, SP-B, SP-C and SP-D. SP-A and SP-D are hydrophilic proteins that regulate surfactant metabolism and have immunologic functions, whereas SP-B and SP-C are hydrophobic molecules, which play a direct role in the organization of the surfactant structure in the interphase and in the stabilization of the lipid layers during the respiratory cycle. Lack of SP-C may result of surfactant metabolism dysfunction and is also observed in patients with other diffuse parenchymal lung diseases, pathogenetically related to the alveolar surfactant region."

It typically occurs on voluntary action and may affect speech and gait. Cortical myoclonic jerks are stimulus sensitive, typically to touch, but sensitivity to visual stimuli is also described. Most patients with cortical myoclonus have both positive myoclonus and NM, occurring either independently or together as a complex of the two kinds of myoclonus. If cortical myoclonus is prolonged and lasts for hours, days or weeks, it is called epilepsia partials continua and is considered to be a rare form of focal epileptic status. Focal cortical myoclonus almost always points to an underlining lesion of the sensori-motor cortex, which produces hyperexcitability (e.g. vascular, inflammatory or neoplastic)."

The symptoms of lumbar spinal stenosis can be explained by an increase in lumbar lordosis and spinal canal stenosis in an upright position compared to the sitting position or if spondylolisthesis is present by a shift of the vertebrae while standing and walking. Following an individually characteristic distance, walking becomes associated with deep muscular pain and with neurological deficits, such as sensory deficits and paresis in the lower limbs, which resolve within minutes when the affected person sits or lies down. Activities performed in a flexed posture, such as cycling often cause less problems than walking. For the same reason, walking uphill may be tolerated better than walking downhill.

The leg is slightly bent at the hip, the knee cannot be extended fully at the end of the stance phase and the foot is inverted and in a plantar flexed position. Gait is slow, with a wide base and asymmetrical with a shortened weight-bearing phase on the paretic side.

The knees are extended or slightly bent and the feet are in a plantar flexion position. This posture requires circumduction of the legs during walking. The gait may appear stiff (spastic gait disorder) or stiff as well as insecure (spastic ataxic gait disorder). In spastic paraparetic gait, each leg appears to be dragged forward. If the muscle tone in the adductors is marked, the resulting gait disorder is referred to as scissor gait."

It passes medial to a normal, but dys- topic, medial canthus. There is an alveolar cleft between the central and lateral incisors that extends above through the pyriform margin lateral to the anterior nasal spine; the nasal septum is not involved. The bony cleft extends through the nasal bone or between the junction of the nasal bone and frontal process of the maxilla. Above the cleft lip, the clefting of the alar dome is associated with deviation to the opposite side of the shortened and broadened columella and nasal tip. Extension of the soft tissue cleft onto the nasal dorsum can be manifest as a series of vertical soft tissue furrows and ridges. Vertical inner canthal dysto- pia and severe telecanthus mark the superior aspect of the Number 1 facial cleft. A cranial soft tissue extension characterized by a tongue-like projection of the frontal hairline delineates the number 13 cleft. Skeletal clefting of the maxilla may extend posteriorly to form a complete cleft of the hard and soft palate. The maxilla is hypoplastic in all three dimensions. There is a keel-shaped alveolus and anterior open bite. Normal septation is preserved between the nasal cavity and the hypoplastic maxillary antrum on the affected side. Distortion of the nasal skeleton produces gross flattening of the nasal dorsum. There is asymmetry of the pterygoid plates, of the greater and lesser wings of the sphenoid, and of the floor of the anterior cranial fossa.

There is normal septation between the nasal cavity and maxillary sinus. Notching at the junction between the nasal bone is present, as is a broad, flat frontal process of the maxilla. Transverse ethmoid enlargement produces orbital hypertelorism. Above the cleft of the lip and palate is a true broad cleft of the nostril that is medial to the intact, but laterally displaced, tail of the alar cartilage. A shallow soft tissue groove extends superiorly to the asymmetrically widened nasal root. The lacrimal system, palpebral fissures, and eyebrows remain intact. The alveolar cleft extends posteriorly as a complete unilateral cleft of the hard and soft palate. The nasal septum is intact but deviated to the opposite side. The nasal cavity remains separated from the normally pneumatized, although hypoplastic, maxilla on the cleft side. Above the nasomaxillary notching, the ethmoid sinus is less well developed, and there is no pneumatization of the frontal sinus on this side. Anterior rotation of the greater and lesser wings of the sphenoid occurs on the cleft side in relation to the narrower orbit and smaller ethmoid sinus.

The alveolar cleft is between the lateral incisor and the canine. Absent septation between the nasal cavity and maxillary antrum, together with the distortion of the frontal process of the maxilla and lacrimal fossa, produces direct communication between the orbit, maxillary sinus, and nose. There is hypoplasia of the soft tissue margins of the cleft in the vertical dimension. This produces extreme soft tissue deficiency between the alar base and the cleft of the medial aspect of the lower eyelid. The inferior lacrimal punctum is evident at the lateral margin of the lower eyelid cleft. The lacrimal drainage system ends as an opening directly onto the cheek without communication into the nasal cavity. The globe is normal in size, but it is displaced inferiorly and laterally. The nasal septum shows the characteristic distortion seen in typical cleft lip and palate. There is absence of septation between the nasal cavity on the cleft side and the maxilla. The maxilla is hypoplastic in three dimensions, with a marked reduction in pneumatization. Superior extension of the skeletal clefting into the medial portion of the orbital floor and into the inferior orbital rim in the region of the frontal process of the maxilla allows direct communication between the orbit above and the nasomaxillary region below. There is mild narrowing of the ethmoid sinus and of the body of the sphenoid on the cleft side.

The alveolar cleft passes between the lateral incisor and canine, as in the Number 3 cleft. The cleft passes around the pyriform aperture and continues through the portion of the maxillary sinus medial to the infraorbital foramen. The cleft terminates at the medial end of the inferior orbital rim. There is severe vertical soft tissue deficiency in a Number 4 cleft, with the medial margins of the cleft lip extending directly into the medially placed cleft of the lower eyelid. Within the medial segment of the right-sided cleft lip, muscle elements are apparently absent. Muscle bunching is noted in the ipsilateral lateral lip segment, as is seen in a typical unilateral cleft lip. The anatomically normal nasal ala is superiorly displaced in association with a severe deficiency in the overall nasal length. Marked dystopia of the right globe results in its inferior displacement into the medially deficient orbital floor and inferior rim. Both globes are otherwise normal. The complete palatal cleft passes through the maxilla medial to the infraorbital foramen and extends to the medial portion of the inferior orbital rim without evidence of an intact maxillary sinus. Bony septation persists medially, thereby separating the nasal cavity from the orbit, maxillary sinus, and mouth, which are contiguous. Marked midfacial hypoplasia is present. The cleft is manifest as asymmetry of the body of the sphenoid; it is smaller on the right, with asymmetric placement of the pterygoid plates relative to the midline. The orbital floor cleft has no communication with the inferior orbital fissure. The cleft does not extend to the skull base, but there is marked facial asymmetry associated with plagiocephaly."

It ends as a cleft at the junction of the middle and lateral third of the lower eyelid. Microphthalmia is frequently present. The alveolar cleft is through the premolar region and extends superiorly through the orbit at the inferolateral part of the rim and floor. There is a vertical soft tissue deficiency between the lateral portion of the lip and the lower eyelid cleft. The left side of the nose shows vertical shortening, and the left alar base is displaced superiorly. Facial asymmetry secondary to the skeletal abnormality is reflected by a vertical orbital dystopia. However, bothglobes are normal, and there is no abnormality of the upper eyelids, eyebrow, forehead, or frontal hairline. The skeletal clefts vary, ranging from a narrow skeletal furrow that traverses the anterior maxillary wall as on the rightto a broad cleft of the maxilla lateral to the infraorbital foramen and maxillary sinus. This latter cleft enters the inferolateral orbital rim and floor without posterior communication with the inferior orbital fissure on the left side. Medial collapse of the lateral maxillary segments is present bilaterally, with reduction in the transverse dimensions of the maxillary arch. Manifestations of the skeletal disturbance in the sphenoid include a shortening and thickening of the lateral orbital walls in the region of the greater wing and mild asymmetric placement of the pterygoid plates relative to the midline. The right-sided pterygoid plates are smaller and closer to the midline. There is minimal asymmetry of the cranial base and calvarium."

The overlying tissue shows a vertical sclerodermic furrow radiating from the labial commissure or the angle of the mandible across the cheek to a coloboma of the lower eyelid between the middle and lateral one-third. Microphthalmia is not observed. The skeletal cleft is between the maxilla and zygoma; it passes through the inferolateral orbital rim to enter the inferior orbital fissure. No alveolar cleft is present. The zygomatic arch is intact. The soft tissue furrow, which is more apparent on the right, radiates from the oral commissure toward the lateral two-thirds of the lower eyelid. The antimongoloid obliquity of the palpebral fissures is associated with laterally placed lower eyelid clefts and some ectropion. A left-sided anophthalmia is accompanied by adjacent soft tissue hypoplasia and is reflected in a short palpebral fissure, enophthalmos, and minor ptosis of the eyebrow. No abnormality is present in the alveolar arch except for some tilting of the occlusal plane secondary to hypoplasia of the left side of the maxilla. There is a vertical bony groove in the region of the zygomaticomaxillary suture that ends in the inferolateral portion of a small bony orbit. More laterally, the remainder of the zygomatic body and arch is normal in both shape and dimension. The lateral orbital floor is downslanting but intact, and it lacks direct communication with the temporal or infratemporal fossae. The hypoplasia of the left side of the maxilla and orbit is associated with a reduction in the transverse and anteroposterior dimensions of the anterior cranial fossa; mild asymmetry of the middle cranial fossa and calvarium is present.

The skeletal cleft is through the pterygomaxillary junction, and vertical maxillary hypoplasia is present. In addition, abnormality of the mandibular ramus, coronoid, and condyle and absence of the zygomatic arch are typically present. A soft tissue furrow extends from the macrostomia laterally and superiorly across the cheek toward the preauricular hairline. The lower eyelids are intact. The anatomy of the external ear is normal, and there are no preauricular tags. Bony clefting is through the pterygomaxillary junction with hypoplasia of the alveolar process in the molar region, thereby producing a posterior open bite. The maxilla is hypoplastic, although the maxillary sinuses are symmetrically pneumatized. The hypoplastic zygomatic body arches upward, but then it takes a downward course and is severely malformed and displaced. The zygoma is continuous posteriorly with an apparently normal zygomatic process of the temporal bone. The mandibular condyle and coronoid process are hypoplastic and asymmetric. There is no antegonial notching of the mandible. Marked cranial base asymmetry, with tilting and asymmetric positioning of the temporomandibular articulations, is present.

Skeletal defects are more prominent in Treacher Collins syndrome, whereas the soft tissue clefting is more typical in cases of ''Goldenhar syndrome''. Soft tissue clefting presents as a dermatocele, a true lateral eyelid coloboma with absence of the outer canthus, and anomalies of the globe itself, especially epibulbar cysts in patients with Goldenhar syndrome. The frontozygomatic bony cleft produces absence of the lateral orbital rim; this border now is formed by the hypoplastic greater wing of the sphenoid. The absence of bony support for the outer canthus produces lateral canthal dystopia and the characteristic antimongoloid slant of the palpebral fissures. Secondary to the bony deficiency in the lateral orbital wall and floor, there is soft tissue continuity between the orbit, temporal fossa, and infratemporal region. Preauricular hairline indicators delineate the Number 8 cleft as the first of the northbound clefts. Complete absence of the bony lateral orbital wall and rim constitute the skeletal element of the Number 8 cleft. The lateral border of the orbit is formed by the greater wing of the sphenoid from which small spicules of bone, which represent the rudimentary zygoma, may be found in Treacher Collins syndrome. The symmetry of the facial anomalies is reflected in the apparently normal symmetric anterior and middle cranial fossae."

The eyebrow is disrupted, being virtually absent medially, whereas the lateral portion angles upward toward the frontal hairline. There may be ocular anomalies, including colobomata of the iris. The skeletal cleft is through the midportion of the supraorbital rim, the adjacent frontal bone, and the orbital roof lateral to the supraorbital nerve. A frontal encephalocele frequently occupies the frontal bony cleft. The palpebral fissure is grossly elongated with an amblyopic eye displaced inferiorly and laterally. There is also a divergent squint of the right eye. The eyebrow is deficient medially and becomes thinned out laterally , where it is contiguous with a broad downward and forward projection of the frontotemporal hairline (this may be seen in both the Number 9 and 10 clefts.) A broad frontal encephalocele bulges forward from the middle one-third of the right forehead, supraorbital ridge, and orbital roof. The bony cleft, through which the frontal encephalocele presents, involves the anterior half of the orbital roof, the supraorbital rim, and two-thirds of the vertical height of the frontal bone lateral to the supraorbital nerve. The bony orbit is inferiorly displaced and widened with the lateral orbital wall shortened and laterally deviated.

Flattening of the frontal process of the maxilla, an increase in the transverse dimension of the ethmoid sinus, and a laterally convex bowing of the medial orbital wall produce orbital hypertelorism. Superiorly there is a minor flattening of the frontal bone medially, and the nasofrontal angle is somewhat obtuse.

There is an increased distance between the olfactory grooves. The crista galli is widened, duplicated, or in some cases absent. Marked inferior prolapse of the enlarged ethmoid bone occurs with orbital hypertelorism. The severe orbital hypertelorism is associated with a broad flattening of the glabella and extreme lateral displacement of the inner canthi. The periorbita, including the eyelids and eyebrows, are otherwise normal. A long midline projection of the frontal hairline marks the superior extent of the soft tissue features of this midline cranial cleft. The median frontal defect delineates the region through which the frontal encephalocele herniates. The lateral segments of the frontal bone sweep upward from the region of the intact glabella and are flattened laterally. No pneumatization of the frontal sinus is evident. The crista galli and the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid are bifid. Just as the ethmoid, including the cribriform plate, is widened and caudally displaced, the sphenoid sinus is broadened and extensively, but symmetrically pneumatized. The lateral rotation of the greater and lesser wings of the sphenoid results in a relative shortening of the anteroposterior dimension of the middle cranial fossa.

They can range from a small focus of divided tissue to long-segment duplication. Fenestrations are the result of partial failure of fusion of paired primitive embryologic vessels or incomplete obliteration of different anastomosis in a primitive vascular network. The association of fenestrations with aneurysms has been suggested in many small case series, though the exact relationship is not well defined."

Accordingly, two distinct subtypes of VIN are recognized: the HPV-associated high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion/usual VIN (HSIL/uVIN) and the non-HPV-associated differentiated VIN (dVIN). HSIL is clinically identified by its multifocal, warty appearance and on histology by conspicuous cytological and architectural atypia. Differentiated VIN, on the other hand, often produces ill-defined lesions, and on histology, notoriously mimics non-neoplastic epithelial disorders (NNED), particularly LS. As a result, dVIN is rarely identified in advance of a diagnosis of invasive malignancy, despite being the precursor lesion of the majority of VSCC."

In both cases these may be recorded with surface or needle electrodes. The CMAP is a summated voltage response from the individual muscle fiber action potentials. The shortest latency of the CMAP is the time from stimulus artifact to onset of the response and is a biphasic response with an initial upward deflection followed by a smaller downward deflection. The CMAP amplitude is measured from baseline to negative peak (the neurophysiological convention is that negative voltage is demonstrated by an upward deflection) and measured in millivolts (mV)."

Differential patterns may manifest as greater impairment in one language compared to another, or as differences in the characteristics of aphasia. Clinical reports of bilingual aphasia show dissociations in the processing of the language learned first (L1) and and second (L2), with one language more impaired than the other. Other cases show a pattern of differential recovery where L2 is recovered only after L1. Another pattern is alternating antagonism; i.e., patients access one language in spontaneous speech and inhibit the other language for alternating periods. This term should be used for a type of aphasia in a person who speaks multiple languages in which the impairment is different for different languages."
