"""
This script processes the HPOA (Human Phenotype Ontology Annotation) file to generate a JSONL file containing diseases and their associated symptoms.

- Input: phenotype.hpoa file (tab-separated values with metadata lines starting with '#').
- Output: disease_kb.jsonl file with disease IDs, names, symptoms (HPO IDs), and additional metadata.

Steps:
1. Load the HPOA file, skipping metadata lines.
2. Group data by disease ID and name, collecting associated symptoms.
3. Write the processed data to a JSONL file, including additional metadata fields.

Usage:
Run this script directly to process the input file and generate the output file.
